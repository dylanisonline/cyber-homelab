## Step 1: Preparing Images

First we must configure our virtual machine software. This project uses VMware Workstation Pro 17 which requires a paid license key. However, there is a trial version of this software that can used. This configuration should be achieveable on free desktop hypervisor solutions such as Virtual Box or VMware Workstation Player.
